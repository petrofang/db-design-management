/* Two tables are created:

Horse with columns:
    ID - integer, primary key
    RegisteredName - variable-length string

Student with columns:
    ID - integer, primary key
    FirstName - variable-length string
    LastName - variable-length string

Create the LessonSchedule table with columns:
    HorseID - integer with range 0 to 65 thousand, not NULL, partial primary key, foreign key references Horse(ID)
    StudentID - integer with range 0 to 65 thousand, foreign key references Student(ID)
    LessonDateTime - date/time, not NULL, partial primary key

If a row is deleted from Horse, the rows with the same horse ID should be deleted from LessonSchedule automatically.

If a row is deleted from Student, the same student IDs should be set to NULL in LessonSchedule automatically.
